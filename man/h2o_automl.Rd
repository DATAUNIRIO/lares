h2o_automl(df, train_test = NA, split = 0.7, seed = 0, thresh = 6,
  max_time = 5 * 60, max_models = 25, export = FALSE,
  project = "Machine Learning Model")
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Dataframe. Dataframe containing all your data, including the independent variable labeled as 'tag'}

\item{train_test}{Character. If needed, df's column name with 'test' and 'train' values to split}

\item{split}{Numeric. Value between 0 and 1 to split as train/test datasets. Value is for training set.}

\item{seed}{Numeric. Seed for random stuff and reproducibility}

\item{thresh}{Integer. Threshold for selecting binary or regression models: this number is the max unique values we should have in 'tag'}

\item{max_time}{Numeric. Max seconds you wish for the function to iterate}

\item{max_models}{Numeric. Max models you wish for the function to create}

\item{export}{Boolean. Do you wish to save results into your working directory?}

\item{project}{Character. Your project's name}
}
\description{
This function lets the user create a robust and fast model, using H2O's AutoML
function. The result is a list with the best model, its parameters, datasets,
performance metrics, variables importances, and others.

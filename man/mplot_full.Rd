\usage{
mplot_full(tag, score, splits = 8, thresh = 6, subtitle = NA,
  model_name = NA, save = FALSE, subdir = NA,
  file_name = "viz_full.png")
}
\arguments{
\item{tag}{Vector. Real known label}

\item{score}{Vector. Predicted value or model's result}

\item{splits}{Integer. Numer of separations to plot}

\item{thresh}{Integer. Threshold for selecting binary or regression 
models: this number is the threshold of unique values we should 
have in 'tag' (more than: regression; less than: classification)}

\item{subtitle}{Character. Subitle to show in plot}

\item{model_name}{Character. Model's name}

\item{save}{Boolean. Save output plot into working directory}

\item{subdir}{Character. Sub directory on which you wish to save the plot}

\item{file_name}{Character. File name as you wish to save the plot}

detect if it's a categorical or regression's model by checking how many different
unique values the independent variable (tag) has.

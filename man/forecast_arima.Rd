\usage{
forecast_arima(time, values, n_future = 30, ARMA = 8,
  wd_excluded = NA, plot = TRUE, plot_days = 90, project = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{POSIX. Vector with date values}

\item{values}{Numeric. Vector with numerical values}

\item{n_future}{Integer. How many steps do you wish to forecast?}

\item{ARMA}{Integer. How many days should the model look backfor ARMA?
Between 7 and 10 days recommmended}

\item{wd_excluded}{Character vector. Which weekdays are excluded in 
your training set. If there are, please define know which ones. Example:
c('Sunday','Thursday')}

\item{plot}{Boolean. If you wish to plot your results}

\item{plot_days}{Integer. How many days back you wish to plot?}

\item{project}{Character. Name of your forecast project}

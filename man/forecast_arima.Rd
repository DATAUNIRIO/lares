\title{ARIMA Forecast}
\usage{
forecast_arima(time, values, n_future = 30, ARMA = 8,
  wd_excluded = NA, plot = TRUE, plot_days = 90, project = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{POSIX. Vector with date values}

\item{values}{Numeric. Vector with numerical values}

\item{n_future}{Integer. How many steps do you wish to forecast?}

\item{ARMA}{Integer. How many days should the model look backfor ARMA?
Between 7 and 10 days recommmended}

\item{wd_excluded}{Character vector. Which weekdays are excluded in 
your training set. If there are, please define know which ones. Example:
c('Sunday','Thursday'). If set to 'auto' then it will detect automatically
which weekdays have no data and forcast without these days.}

\item{plot}{Boolean. If you wish to plot your results}

\item{plot_days}{Integer. How many days back you wish to plot?}

\item{project}{Character. Name of your forecast project}
}
\description{
This function automates the ARIMA iterations and modeling for 
time forecasting. For the moment, units can only be days.
}
\details{
The ARIMA method is appropriate only for a time series that is 
stationary (i.e., its mean, variance, and autocorrelation should 
be approximately constant through time) and it is recommended 
that there are at least 50 observations in the input data.

One thing to keep in mind when we think about ARIMA models is 
given by the great power to capture very complex patters of 
temporal correlation (Cochrane, 1997: 25)

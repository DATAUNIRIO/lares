\title{Cumulative Response Plot}
\usage{
mplot_response(tag, score, target = "auto", splits = 10,
  highlight = "auto", caption = NA, save = FALSE, subdir = NA,
  file_name = "viz_response.png")
}
\arguments{
\item{tag}{Vector. Real known label}

\item{score}{Vector. Predicted value or model's result}

\item{target}{Value. Which is your target positive value? If 
set to 'auto', the target with largest mean(score) will be 
selected. Change the value to overwrite.}

\item{splits}{Integer. Numer of quantiles to split the data}

\item{highlight}{Character or Integer. Which split should be used
for the automatic conclussion in the plot? Set to "auto" for

\item{caption}{Character. Caption to show in plot}

\item{subdir}{Character. Sub directory on which you wish to save the plot}

\item{file_name}{Character. File name as you wish to save the plot}

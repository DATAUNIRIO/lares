\section{Why Arial Narrow?}{

First and foremost, Arial Narrow is generally installed by default or readily
available on any modern system, so it's "free"-ish; plus, it is a condensed font
with solid default kerning pairs and geometric numbers.

There is an option \code{hrbrthemes.loadfonts} which -- if set to \code{TRUE} -- will
call \code{extrafont::loadfonts()} to register non-core fonts with R PDF & PostScript
devices. If you are running under Windows, the package calls the same function
to register non-core fonts with the Windows graphics device.
